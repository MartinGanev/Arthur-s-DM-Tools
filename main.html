			<p> Why keep a thousand pages of every possible player/npc interaction at hand?
				Why write about 10 pages worth of D&D encounters? 
				Why draw that one scene from your last campaign where the <a href = "https://66.media.tumblr.com/e780e1c122b6eeae4c94ac9ce976a20b/tumblr_p1e07cVafN1uli2koo1_500.jpg">bard charmed the dragon and the dragon decided to f*** him?</a>

			<p> <ins>DM Tools</ins> is a project made by me, Arthur Deadmun. It's a simulation of various D&D encounters, not only with monsters, but with merchants, blacksmiths, priests, npc-s. It's been in development for 2 years already and its non-profit, but if you wish, you can support the team on patreon (link at the end).</p>
